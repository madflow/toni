# What is Toni and why should I care.

You shouldn't actually. Use [jekyll][7] or [hyde][8] or something. The whole concept is adapted on a [blog post][6] by Nicolas Perriault with some monkey code around it.

But... Since there has to be some content...

***
Toni is a ubercool (and just another) static website generator build on top of [Flask][1], [Frozen-Flask][2], [Flask-FlatPages][3]. It is obviously written in [Python][4] and uses [Markdown][5] as its primary Markup Language for generating content.
***

Even though it needs Python for the generator backend - you can publish the static content on any webserver that can serve HTML files.
